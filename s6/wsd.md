# Mandatory exercise

Statement:

1. Read all pairs of sentences of the trial set within the evaluation framework of the project.

2. Apply Leskâ€™s algorithm to the words in the sentences.

3. Compute their similarities by considering senses and Jaccard coefficient.

4. Compare the results with those in session 2 (document) and 3 (morphology) in which words and lemmas were considered.

5. Compare the results with gold standard by giving the pearson correlation between them.
