# Coreference in spaCy I

### Requirements

```python3
!pip install spacy==2.1.0
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
!pip install neuralcoref

import spacy
import neuralcoref

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
neuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp)
```

### Use

```python3
doc = nlp(u'My sister has a dog. She loves him.')

doc._.has_coref  ðŸ‘‰  True

doc._.coref_clusters
ðŸ‘‰  [My sister: [My sister, She], a dog: [a dog, him]]
```

# Exercise

* Consider the first paragraph in Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll:
```
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, 
and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her 
sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, â€˜and what 
is the use of a book,â€™ thought Alice â€˜without pictures or conversations?â€™
```

* Apply the spaCy coreference solver to the previous paragraph.

* Show the coreference chains. 

* What do you think about them? Justify your answer.
