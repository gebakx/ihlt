#### Statement:

* Consider the first paragraph in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll:
```
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, 
and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her 
sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what 
is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversations?’
```
